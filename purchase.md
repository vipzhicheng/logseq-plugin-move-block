# Purchase

You can use this plugin to move blocks in Logseq easily and efficiently.

You can use most of the features for free. But for better maintenance, I decided to set a fee for a few of the features.

After purchasing, I will send you an email with the license key. The key will expire in 48 hours.

The license can be activated on as many devices as you want within 48 hours. Do not clean the Logseq cache because it will lose the activation. No time limitation exists only if your activation exists.

For users out of China Mainland, you can purchase the the plugin here:

<div style="display: flex; margin-top: 20px;">
